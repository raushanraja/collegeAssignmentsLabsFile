#### 3.1 Purpose Scheduling
+ In computing, scheduling is the method by which process manager handles the removal of a running/finished process from CPU and selection of another process based on a parituclar scheduling algorithm.
+ A scheduler may aim at one or more of many goals such as:
    + Allowing multiple users to share the system resource effectively
    + Keep all computer resource bysu, as in load balancing
    + Maximizing throughput (total amount of work completed in unit time)
    + Minimizing wait time ( time from work becoming ready untill first point it begins execution)
    + Minimizing latency or response time (time from becoming ready to first response)
    + Maximizing Fairness (Sharing time between process according to workload)
    + Avoiding deadlock when sharing the CPU resources between process


#### 3.2 Types of Scheduling Algorithm
+ Linear (Tradition) Scheduling algorithm : FCFS, SJF, RR, Priority Scheduling
+ Distributed Scheduling algorithm

##### 3.2.1 Linear Scheduling Algorithm

##### 3.2.2 Distributed Scheduling Algorithm
+ These algorithm helps to schedule the clould services on cloud environment
+ Generally cloud scheduling probelms as NP-Hard problems which cannot be solved using Linear Scheduling algorithm, that is why distributed algorithms are used to scheduling cloud services.
+ Some exapmle of distributes scheduling algorithm are: Max-Min algorithm, Min-Min algorithm etc.




#### 3.3 Introduction to Cloud Simulator

##### 3.3.1 Cloud Simulator
+ A cloud simulator helps in modelling various kinds of cloud applications by creating virtual data centers, virtual hosts, VMs, cloudlets that can be configured easily.
+ It provides real-time and real-world evaluation of the cloud services inside a programm, so that cost effective and practical cloud services can be developed and analyzed easily.

##### 3.3.2 Benifits of cloud simulators
+ Minimal Cost: Purchasing software costs less when compared to purchasing hardware and proprietary software (operating systems, hypervisor etc). Also many simulators are available free of cost.
+ Repeatable and Controllable: We can test our experimental set up (simulation) as many times as we want until we get the desirable output.
+ Environment: A simulator provides environment for evaluation of various scenarios under different workloads.

##### 3.3.3 CloudSim
+ CloudSim is a cloud simulation tool for modeling and simulation of cloud computing infrastructures and services.
+ CloudSim is the most popular simulation tool available for cloud computing environment. 
+ It is an event driven simulator built up on the core of grid simulator GridSim.
+ Base programming language for CloudSim is Java and that is why CloudSim modules are easy to extend.

###### 3.3.3.1 Features of CloudSim
+ Support modeling and simulation of large scale computing environment.
+ Supports simulation of both single and inter-networked cloud (federation of clouds)
+ Flexibility to switch between space shared and time shared allocation of processing cores to virtualized services.
+ Support for simulation of network connections among the simulated system elements
+ Avalability of virtualization engine allows creation of multiple and independent co-hosted virtual cloud services on a data center node.

##### 3.3.4 HDFS ( Hadoop Distributed File System)
+ HDFS stands for Hadoop Distributed File System, developed on the basis of distributed file design.
+ HDFS is a unique design that provides storage for extremely large files with streaming data access pattern and it runs on commodity hardware.
+ It holds large amount of data and provides easier access to the data.
+ It is higly fault tolerant and the files are stored in redundant fashion so that data recovery can be easier in case of any failure.

###### 3.3.5 Feature of HDFS:
+ It is suitable for the distributed storage and & processing.
+ It provides a command line tool to interact with HDFS.
+ Allows streaming access to to file system and data.
+ It has various file premission and authentication functionality.
+ It has high throughput.
HDFS are highly fault tolerant.

##### Components of HDF Architecture
+ DataNode
+ NameNode
+ Client Node


> DataNode
> + Containes structured or unstructured data
> + Stores the matadata.
> + Replication is also done by datanodes

> NameNode
> + It executes file system to provide services to client
> + It is the primary entity which supports the communication between client and data node

> ClientNode
> + It is the node which writes or requests the data from HDFS file system.
